# Welcome!

Iâ€™m a technical leader and software engineer who specializes in designing, building, and shipping data-centric applications.

Currently, I work as a research fellow at the UMass School of Public Health, in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (specifically, the [Reich Lab](https://reichlab.io/)).

From 2017-2023, I worked at Atlassian&mdash;which owns Bitbucket, a GitHub competitor&mdash; and don't have professional GitHub contributions during that time.

This GitHub is also full of [2016](https://github.com/bsweger?tab=overview&from=2016-12-01&to=2016-12-31)-[17](https://github.com/bsweger?tab=overview&from=2017-12-01&to=2017-12-31) activity on the open-source [USASpending.gov website](https://www.usaspending.gov/) and a few newer hobby projects, like sending [nearby bird sightings](https://github.com/bsweger/tidbyt-community/tree/main/apps/birdbyt) to a [retro digital display](https://tidbyt.com/).
