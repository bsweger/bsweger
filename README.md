# Welcome!

Iâ€™m a technical leader and software engineer who specializes in designing, building, and shipping data-centric applications.

Because I've been working at Atlassian&mdash;which owns Bitbucket, a GitHub competitor&mdash;I don't have recent professional contributions in this space.

Instead, this GitHub is full of [2016](https://github.com/bsweger?tab=overview&from=2016-12-01&to=2016-12-31)-[17](https://github.com/bsweger?tab=overview&from=2017-12-01&to=2017-12-31) activity on the open-source [USASpending.gov website](https://www.usaspending.gov/) and a few newer hobby projects, like sending [nearby bird sightings](https://github.com/bsweger/tidbyt-community/tree/main/apps/birdbyt) to a [retro digital display](https://tidbyt.com/).
