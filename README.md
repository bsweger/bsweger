# Welcome!

Iâ€™m a technical leader and software engineer who specializes in designing, building, and shipping data-centric applications.

Currently, I work as a research fellow at the UMass School of Public Health, in the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology (specifically, the [Reich Lab]([https://reichlab.io/)](https://reichlab.io/people)). Some open source work from this job includes:

- [Cladetime](https://cladetime.readthedocs.io/), a Python interface for accessing past and present Nextrain-produced SARS-CoV-2 sequence data and performing point-in-time clade assignments.
- Data pipelines for the [SARS-CoV-2 Variant Nowcast Hub](https://reichlab.io/variant-nowcast-hub-dashboard/), a collaborative modeling exercise to predict the prevalence of predominant COVID-19 strains in U.S. states.

From 2017-2023, I worked as a data engineer at Atlassian&mdash;which owns Bitbucket, a GitHub competitor&mdash; and don't have professional GitHub contributions during that time.

Other work here includes: 

- [2016](https://github.com/bsweger?tab=overview&from=2016-12-01&to=2016-12-31)-[17](https://github.com/bsweger?tab=overview&from=2017-12-01&to=2017-12-31) activity on the open-source [USASpending.gov website](https://www.usaspending.gov/) I built while at [18F](https://18f.org)
- [pyprefab](https://bsweger.github.io/pyprefab), CLI that creates Python package scaffolding
- the [Birdbyt app](https://github.com/bsweger/tidbyt-community/tree/main/apps/birdbyt) for [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com/)
